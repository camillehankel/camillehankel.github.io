I am a CICOES and NSF Atmosphere and Geospace Sciences Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Washington, advised by Cecilia Bitz and Wei Cheng.

I am interested in nonlinearities in the climate system and positive feedback mechanisms, particularly those that apply to the high latitudes. Currently, I am working towards building an understanding of how the _rate_ of anthropogenic warming (not just the magnitude) affects large-scale climate phenomena such as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and polar amplified warming. I am also interested in the dynamical systems properties that govern Arctic sea ice and may influence its potential for abrupt disappearance in a warming climate. I broadly tend towards a hierarchical modeling approach in my research, seeking inspiration from observations and realistic climate model output and implementing simple toy models to provide mechanistic insight into complex phenomena.
