I am a Ph.D. candidate studying Climate Dynamics in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at Harvard University, advised by Eli Tziperman.

I am interested in multiple climate equilibria, bifurcation theory and nonlinear dynamics, and positive feedback mechanisms. Specifically, I work understanding the dynamical systems that influence the stability of Arctic sea ice, in order to understand the potential for abrupt sea ice loss in a warming climate.
