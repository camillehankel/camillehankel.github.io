I am a CICOES and NSF Atmosphere and Geospace Sciences Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Washington, advised by Cecilia Bitz and Wei Cheng (NOAA PMEL).

I am interested in multiple climate equilibria, bifurcation theory and nonlinear dynamics, and positive feedback mechanisms. Specifically, I work on understanding the dynamical systems that influence the stability of Arctic sea ice in order to study the potential for abrupt sea ice loss in a warming climate. I am also interested in how the _rate_ of anthropogenic warming (not just the magnitude) affects climate phenomena (such as AMOC) that are governed by mechanisms operating at both slow and fast timescales. I broadly tend towards a hierarchical modeling approach in my research, seeking inspiration from observations and realistic climate model output and implementing simple toy models to provide mechanistic insight into complex phenomena.
