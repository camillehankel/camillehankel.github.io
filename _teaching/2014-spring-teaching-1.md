I served as the Head TF for this course which applies linear algebra concepts to analysis of large datasets, including topics such as principle component analysis, singular value decomposition, clustering, and neural networks. I received the Earth and Planetary Sciences Teaching Award for my role in 2020, and the Bok Center Certificate of Distinction in Teaching in 2021.
